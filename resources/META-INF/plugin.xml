    Shows the user the keyboard short-cuts when a button is pressed with the mouse. This provides an easy way to learn how
     to replace tedious mouse work with keyboard keys and helps to transition to a faster, mouse free development.
     Currently, it supports toolbar buttons, menu buttons, and tool windows and the actions therein.
     <br />
     <br />
     The plugin was initially implemented by Dmitry Kashin and further improved by athiele.
     The version here is removes the custom pop-up window with IntelliJ internal message balloons.
     It, therefore, integrates much better into the IDE, fixes glitches and provides a more non-disruptive
     way of learning shortcut bindings.
