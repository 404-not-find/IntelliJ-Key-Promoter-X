    The Key Promoter X has now reached over 320.000 downloads. It is top-rated on the JetBrains
    site, and since it is entirely open-source, other plugin developers can browse through the code to understand how
    things are implemented.

    The plugin is not for me or a by-product of something I would do anyway. It is for <b>you</b> who want to learn
    shortcuts in IntelliJ IDEA, and I give away some of my free time to keep it up to date and fix bugs. If you
    appreciate my efforts, then

<h3>Latest changes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Your shortcut statistic is now kept local to prevent merging conflicts when using IDEA's "Settings repository"
        to keep configuration in sync on multiple workstations
        (<a href="https://github.com/halirutan/IntelliJ-Key-Promoter-X/issues/40">Issue 40</a>)
    </li>
    <li>Add features that let's you turn off KPX in Presentation and Distraction Free Mode
        (<a href="https://github.com/halirutan/IntelliJ-Key-Promoter-X/issues/39">Issue 39</a>)
    </li>
    <li>Fix instances where the KPX would not recognize a mouse-click. This replaces a hack that worked around an
        <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-219133">issue in IDEA</a> with still another hack that
        hopefully works better.
    </li>
