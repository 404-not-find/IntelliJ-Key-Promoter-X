    Here is the new Key Promoter X which works on 2019.3EAP and fixes a long-time annoyance when displaying Run/Debug
    shortcuts.
    As usual, it's entirely free and open-source, and if you enjoy it, I would like to ask you to
    <a href="https://ko-fi.com/pleasureoffiguring">buy a coffee for my friend and fellow StackExchange moderator Jan</a>.
</p>
<p>
    He <a href="https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/users/50/j-m-will-be-back-soon?tab=answers&sort=votes">helps
    thousands of people</a>
    with his <a
        href="https://tpfto.wordpress.com/2019/04/24/on-constructing-an-elliptic-function-from-its-zeroes-and-poles/">mathematical
    knowledge</a>,
    but unfortunately, his old 32bit Netbook finally passed away, and he is not in the position to buy a new one.
    If you ever considered helping out a stranger, he is the right one. Go ahead, buy him a coffee, and don't forget to
    say "Hi" from me :)</p>

<h3>Latest changes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Make compatible with 2019.3 EAP products</li>
    <li>Fix display of Run and Debug actions which will from now not display the specific run configuration and
        therefore
        count all these as one entry (<a href="https://github.com/halirutan/IntelliJ-Key-Promoter-X/issues/44">Issue
            44</a>).
        You need to "Reset Statistics" in the toolbar to get rid of existing entries.
