    Since its first release, the Key Promoter X had more than 200.000 downloads. It is top-rated on the JetBrains site,
    and since it is entirely open-source, other plugin developers can browse through the code to understand how things
    are implemented.

    The plugin is not for me or a byproduct of something I would do anyway. It is for <em>you</em> who want to learn
    shortcuts in IntelliJ IDEA, and I give away some of my free time to keep it up to date and fix bugs. If you
    appreciate my efforts, then please <a href="https://www.paypal.me/halirutan">donate some money</a>.
