    Since its first release, the Key Promoter X has now more than 240.000 downloads. It is top-rated on the JetBrains
    site,
    and since it is entirely open-source, other plugin developers can browse through the code to understand how things
    are implemented.
</p>
<p>
    The plugin is not for me or a by-product of something I would do anyway. It is for <em>you</em> who want to learn
    shortcuts in IntelliJ IDEA, and I give away some of my free time to keep it up to date and fix bugs. If you
    appreciate my efforts, then please <a href="https://www.paypal.me/halirutan">donate some money</a>.
    And don't forget to <a href="https://github.com/halirutan/IntelliJ-Key-Promoter-X">star the GitHub repository</a>
    and
    leave a rating on the <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9792-key-promoter-x">JetBrains plugin site</a>.
